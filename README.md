## 🔮 What is Quoniam?
Quoniam is not just a music player. It is a **generative audio engine** that creates infinite, non-repetitive soundscapes in real-time. By combining a **Hybrid Audio Architecture** (High-quality natural samples + MIDI procedural generation), it creates the perfect atmosphere for deep work or meditation.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🎹 Hybrid Engine:** Seamlessly blends real-world ambience loops (Rain, Wind, City) with procedural MIDI orchestration (Piano, Strings, Zen Bells).
* **🎨 Liquid Glass UI:** A modern, responsive interface built entirely in Python with Flet.
* **🧠 Emotional Intelligence:** Select moods (Cyber, Zen, Winter, Void) that instantly adapt the color palette and sonic texture.
* **🎛️ Live Controls:** Adjust "Chaos", "Gravity", and "Tempo" to influence the algorithmic composition in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.11+
* **GUI:** [Flet](https://flet.dev) (Flutter for Python)
* **Audio Generation:** [SCAMP](http://scamp.marcevanstein.com/) & FluidSynth
* **Architecture:** Multithreaded rendering for lag-free UI.
